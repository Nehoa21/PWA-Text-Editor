# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA) Text Editor. You can use it as an advanced notepad for taking notes, or preferrably as a code snippet, as it distinguishes the color of the code. What makes this app nice is you can use it online or offline just by simply downloading it and all information will be saved.
